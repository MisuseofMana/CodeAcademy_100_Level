                Sean Yager, a.k.a Shin, a.k.a Misuse of Mana, is a cartoonist and comic 
                illustrator located in Austin, TX. By day he codes, creates, and 
                maintains a myriad of websites for various clients. By night he 
                summons creatures, camaraderie, and conflicts to enrich his comic
                universe, the realm of Amara.

                He grew up in the Indiana cornfields swinging tree branch swords and 
                imagining backyard adventures. Sean attended IUPUI and Herron School 
                of Art for several years before deciding that college wasn’t going to 
                hack it. He now works freelance for himself on the side while taking on 
                coding jobs to pay the bills.

                Among his smattering of web based content he self publishes 
                his work, such as his poetry comic “IRE”, and the ambitious 
                Dungeons and Dragons inspired bestiary/game-ifiyed booklet 
                “Dungeons of Amara”. He also publishes monthly doodle zines 
                which are evolving into Dungeon World fan content, called “Zine 
                Cuisine” and has been doing so for almost three years. The name’s 
                probably gonna change soon to something more fantasy-esque.
